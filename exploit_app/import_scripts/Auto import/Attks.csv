AttackID,Name,Target,Description
1,LFI,Web,"Local file inclusion is a common vulnerability found, but not restricted to, PHP websites. when a website calls a file from the server behind it you can manipulate the input sent to the sever (normally the URL) and get it to read other files from the server"
2,Re-Registration,Web,Registering with a known username with a space in front of it will force the SQL back end to overwrite the details to the existing user. This might give access to the account with that name or simply can be used for Social Engineering using a small modification of a username
3,No Auth,Web,This is the case of swapping round users through URL manipulation.
4,IDOR/Forced Browsing,Web,"Insecure Direct Object Reference is an exploit for accessing resources that you wouldn’t normally see, this is done with misconfigured input. simply changing the URL gives access to hiden parts of the website"
5,API Bypassing,Web,"ignoring the API all together and running commands on the back end, this is normally a bakdoor for developers"
6,JWT manipulation,Web,A JSON web token is a kind of cookie designed to tell the website the kind of access it has. These can be maniplated client side to gain access to restricted data
7,Upload Vulnerabilities,Web,"poorly handled upload features on websites can result in Remote Code Execution.
There are often filters the need bypassed such as Extention validation, MIME Validation, Magic Number validation, File length, File name and File content"
8,SSRF,Web,"Using a websites back end to make requests to other servers and returning information via the API, this can be used to access servers that are hiddent behind a firewall"
9,XXE,Web,XML External Entity abuses XML requests made to websites and uses them to access sensetive information this can be in-band or out-of-band
10,PHP Deserialization,Web,Deserialization is when the serialized object is read from a file or the network and converted back into an object. This attack is done by controling the information that is to be serialized by the PHP function.
11,Login Timings,Web,
12,HTTP Request Smuggling,Web,"This is when there is a miscomunication between the front end and the back end of a website, meaning that malicious requests can pass the front end and be executed by the back end, this is normally done with manipulation of Transfer encoding/Content length headers in requests"
13,Session Jacking,Web,This is when an attacker steals someones cookies (the unique identifiers) of users are harvested then used to make requests to impersonate that user.
14,XSS,Web,"Cross Site Scripting is when malicious scrips are executed on a site without the developers knowledge. These can be Reflected, Sorted or DOM-Based"
15,SSTI,Web,This is an injection weakness in static html pages with dynamic elements. This is exploited by an attacker by passing parameters that can control the engine running on the server.
16,CSRF,Web,Cross Site Request forgery is manipulating the back end server of a website to make requests to another website
17,Kerberoasting,Kerberos,Kerboeroasting is stealing or forging kerberos tickets. Adversaries may abuse a valid Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) or sniff network traffic to obtain a ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket that may be vulnerable to Brute Force
18,Phishing,Human,Sending fraudulent communications that appear to reputable to encorage people to discole private information
19,MITM,Network,Man-in-the-Middle attack is an eavesdropping attack where an attacker intercepts comunication in an attempt to gather information about a target
20,DoS,Network,Denial of Service is when a service is taken offline though malicious activity from an attacker
21,DDoS,Netwrok,Distributed Denial of Service is when a network service is flooded with network traffic in order to exhaust bandwith and effectivly take the service offline
22,SQL injection,Web,inputting malicious code into a website form (with a back end database) to maniplate/show the database
23,DNS Tunneling,Web,"DNS requests are manipulated to exfiltrate data from a compromised system to the attacker’s infrastructure without detection, port 53 is normally open."
24,Buffer Overflow,Programs,overflowing the variable buffer in a program to point the return address to malicious code that will then be executed
25,DNS Poisining,System,editing the DNS of a network or system to direct trafic to somewhere that wasnt intended
26,Clickjacking,Human,this is where someone is convinced to click on a malicious link thought social engineering
27,Watering hole,Human,compromising a resourse that someone or a company often uses in order to infect their network
28,Typosquatting,Human,this relies on mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser taking the user to a malicious version of a known site
29,Zero-day,All,a previously unknown exploit
30,Downgrade Attack,All,"Forcing a network or system to revert to an older version of communication protocol that is less protected, ofent used in MitM attack"
31,Golden Ticket,Kerberos,
32,Brute forcing,All,
33,Pass-the-ticket,Kerberos,
34,DCShadow,Kerberos,
35,Over-Reads,Programs,"This is when a program, while reading data from a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and reads (or tries to read) adjacent memory"
36,HTML injection,Web,injecting Malicious HTML into a web app
37,PHP file creation,Web,"arbitrary code execution is achieved through crafting a script server-side (via upload or file creation bug), and parsing it to exploit a known bug."
38,ARP Spoofing,Network,Changing an IP associated with a MAC address on a LAN hereby redirecting users on that LAN potently somewhere malicious 
39,MAC Spoofing,Network,Spoofing a MAC address to gain access to a network
40,IP Spoofing,Network,"Impersonates another machine by modifying an IP packet header, checksum and order value"
41,Amplification Attack,Network,"The attacker wants a greater than 1:1 response from a system, hereby slowing the system down. Normally part of a DDoS attack"
42,Evil Twin,Wireless,Rouge WAP acting as a legit service
43,Rogue AP,Wireless,Any wireless access point added to your network that’s unauthorized
44,Initialization Vector,Wireless,"An initialization vector is a random number used in combination with a secret key as a means to encrypt data, if this is known/calculated then the encryption isn't secure (this is a particular weakness of WEP, small IVs)"
45,Jamming,Wireless,Interfearing with wireless signals
46,Bluejacking,Wireless,Bluetooth spam
47,Bluesnarfing,Wireless,intercepting bluetooth data
48,Replay,Network,Captures portion of a session to play back later convincing a host that it continues to communicate
49,DLL Injection,System,DLL injection is a technique used for running code within the address space of another process by forcing it to load a dynamic-link library
50,Null Dereference,System,"A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit"
