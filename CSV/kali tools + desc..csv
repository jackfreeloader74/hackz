The output of new interface of diStorm is a special structure that can describe any x86 instruction, this structure can be later formatted into text for display too. diStorm is written in C, but for rapidly use, diStorm also has wrappers in Python/Ruby/Java and can easily be used in C as well. It is also the fastest disassembler library!. The source code is very clean, readable, portable and platform independent (supports both little and big endianity). diStorm solely depends on the C library, therefore it can be used in embedded or kernel modules. Note that diStorm3 is backward compatible with the interface of diStorm64 (however, make sure you use the newest header files)."
edb-debugger,A Linux equivalent of the famous Olly debugger on the Windows platform. Some of its features are:.

With access the original source, you can run a simple Java program and attach a debugger to it remotely, stepping through code and changing variables where needed. Doing the same with an applet is a little bit more difficult."

dos2unix,"This package contains utilities dos2unix, unix2dos, mac2unix, unix2mac to convert the line endings of text files between UNIX (LF), DOS (CRLF) and Mac (CR) formats. Text files under Windows and DOS typically have two ASCII characters at the end of each line: CR (carriage return) followed by LF (line feed). Older Macs used just CR, while UNIX uses just LF. While most modern editors can read all these formats, there may still be a need to convert files between them. This is the classic utility developed in 1989."

All this is done without your intervention."
easside-ng,"Easside-ng is an auto-magic tool which allows you to communicate via an WEP-encrypted access point (AP) without knowing the WEP key.

All this is done without your intervention."
makeivs-ng,makeivs-ng is part of the aircrack-ng package and is used to generate an IVS dump file with a given WEP key.  The aim of the tool is to provide a way to create dumps with a  known encryption key for testing.
